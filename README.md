##NOTE
I complete a 100% functional Demo, but still missing some tasks to deliver all requirements specified by the Project Evaluation Test, mainly because my internet connection, is intermittent, And the many “scheduled” power outages in my country. I Have two possible planned solutions for this problem, 1) Buy a small mobile power plant, and get other phone lines (hard), 2) Buy a Laptop, and smartphone and use it as a modem. But all these solutions require collecting money for a while.
